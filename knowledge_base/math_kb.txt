mark bought a set of 6 flower pots of different sizes at a total cost of $ 8.25 . each pot cost 0.1 more than the next one below it in size . what was the cost , in dollars , of the largest pot ?
Answer: $ 1.62
Explanation: this question can be solved with a handful of different algebra approaches ( as has been shown in the various posts ) . since the question asks for the price of the largest pot , and the answers are prices , we can test the answers . we ' re told that there are 6 pots and that each pot costs 25 cents more than the next . the total price of the pots is $ 8.25 . we ' re asked for the price of the largest ( most expensive ) pot . since the total price is $ 8.25 ( a 10 - cent increment ) and the the difference in sequential prices of the pots is 10 cents , the largest pot probably has a price that is a 10 - cent increment . from the answer choices , i would then test answer a first if . . . . the largest pot = $ 1.625 1.125 1.225 1.325 1.425 1.525 1.625 total = $ 8.25 so this must be the answer . a

Explanation: the exam gives us a number that is easily divisible by 7 to pique our curiosity and tempt us into calculating actual numbers ( also because otherwise the ratio would be incorrect ) . since the question is about percentages , the actual numbers will be meaningless , as only the ratio of that number versus others will be meaningful . nonetheless , for those who are curious , each 1 / 7 portion represents ( 14210 / 7 ) 2,030 employees . this in turn means that 4,060 employees are journeymen and the remaining 10,150 are full time workers . if half the journeymen were laid off , that would mean 1 / 7 of the total current workforce would be removed . this statistic is what leads many students to think that since half the journeymen are left , the remaining journeymen would represent half of what they used to be , which means 1 / 7 of the total workforce . if 1 / 7 of the workforce is journeymen , and 1 / 7 is roughly 14.3 % , then answer choice a should be the right answer . in this case , though , it is merely the tempting trap answer choice . what changed between the initial statement and the final tally ? well , you let go of 1 / 7 of the workforce , so the total number of workers went down . the remaining workers are still 1 / 7 of the initial workers , but the group has changed . the new workforce is smaller than the original group , specifically 6 / 7 of it because 1 / 7 was eliminated . the remaining workers now account for 1 / 7 out of 6 / 7 of the force , which if we multiply by 7 gives us 1 out of 6 . this number as a percentage is answer choice b , 28.6 % . using the absolute numbers we calculated before , there were 4,060 journeymen employees out of 14,210 total . if 2,030 of them are laid off , then there are 2,030 journeyman employees left , but now out of a total of ( 14,210 - 2,030 ) 12,180 employees . 2,030 / 12,180 is exactly 1 / 6 , or 16.67 % . the answer will work with either percentages or absolute numbers , but the percentage calculation will be significantly faster and applicable to any similar situation . the underlying principle of percentages ( and , on a related note , ratios ) can be summed up in the brainteaser i like to ask my students : if you ’ re running a race and you overtake the 2 nd place runner just before the end , what position do you end up in ? the correct answer is 2 nd place . percentages , like ratios and other concepts of relative math , depend entirely on the context . whether 100 % more of something is better than 50 % more of something else depends on the context much more than the percentages quoted . when it comes to percentages on the gmat , the goal is to understand them enough to instinctively not fall into the traps laid out for you . d

Explanation: speed of first train = ( 120 * 5 / 18 ) m / sec = 100 / 3 m / sec speed of other train = ( 80 * 5 / 18 ) m / sec = 200 / 9 m / sec time to cross each other = 9 sec let x be the length of 2 nd train therefore 9 = ( 270 + x ) / ( 100 / 3 + 200 / 9 ) 500 = 270 + x 230 m = x

a sum of money is to be divided among ann , bob and chloe . first , ann receives $ 4 plus one - half of what remains . next , bob receives $ 4 plus one - third of what remains . finally , chloe receives the remaining $ 32 . how much money t did bob receive ?
Answer: 22
Explanation: notice that we need not consider ann ' s portion in the solution . we can just let k = the money remaining after ann has received her portion and go from there . our equation will use the fact that , once we remove bob ' s portion , we have $ 32 for chloe . so , we getk - bob ' s $ = 32 bob received 4 dollars plus one - third of what remained once bob receives $ 4 , the amount remaining is k - 4 dollars . so , bob gets a 1 / 3 of that as well . 1 / 3 of k - 4 is ( k - 4 ) / 3 so altogether , bob receives 4 + ( k - 4 ) / 3 so , our equation becomes : k - [ 4 + ( k - 4 ) / 3 ] = 32 simplify to get : k - 4 - ( k - 4 ) / 3 = 32 multiply both sides by 3 to get : 3 k - 12 - k + 4 = 96 simplify : 2 k - 8 = 96 solve : k = 52 plug this k - value intok - bob ' s $ = 32 to get : 52 - bob ' s $ = 32 so , bob ' s $ t = 20

15 lts are taken of from a container full of liquid a and replaced with liquid b . again 15 more lts of the mixture is taken and replaced with liquid b . after this process , if the container contains liquid a and b in the ratio 9 : 16 , what is the capacity of the container s ?
Answer: c : 37.5
Explanation: if you have a 37.5 liter capacity , you start with 37.5 l of a and 0 l of b . 1 st replacement after the first replacement you have 37.5 - 15 = 22.5 l of a and 15 l of b . the key is figuring out how many liters of a and b , respectively , are contained in the next 15 liters of mixture to be removed . the current ratio of a to total mixture is 22.5 / 37.5 ; expressed as a fraction this becomes ( 45 / 2 ) / ( 75 / 2 ) , or 45 / 2 * 2 / 75 . canceling the 2 s and factoring out a 5 leaves the ratio as 9 / 15 . note , no need to reduce further as we ' re trying to figure out the amount of a and b in 15 l of solution . 9 / 15 of a means there must be 6 / 15 of b . multiply each respective ratio by 15 to get 9 l of a and 6 l of b in the next 15 l removal . final replacement the next 15 l removal means 9 liters of a and 6 liters of b are removed and replaced with 15 liters of b . 22.5 - 9 = 13.5 liters of a . 15 liters of b - 6 liters + 15 more liters = 24 liters of b . test to the see if the final ratio = 9 / 16 ; 13.5 / 24 = ( 27 / 2 ) * ( 1 / 24 ) = 9 / 16 . choice c is correct .

a 20 litre mixture of milk and water contains milk and water in the ratio 3 : 2 . 10 litres of the mixture is removed and replaced with pure milk and the operation is repeated once more . at the end of the two removal and replacement , what is the ratio e of milk and water in the resultant mixture ?
Answer: 9 : 1
Explanation: he 20 litre mixture contains milk and water in the ratio of 3 : 2 . therefore , there will be 12 litres of milk in the mixture and 8 litres of water in the mixture . step 1 . when 10 litres of the mixture is removed , 6 litres of milk is removed and 4 litres of water is removed . therefore , there will be 6 litres of milk and 4 litres of water left in the container . it is then replaced with pure milk of 10 litres . now the container will have 16 litres of milk and 4 litres of water . step 2 . when 10 litres of the new mixture is removed , 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water is removed . the container will have 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it . now 10 litres of pure milk is added . therefore , the container will have 18 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it at the end of the second step . therefore , the ratio of milk and water is 18 : 2 or 9 : 1 . shortcut . we are essentially replacing water in the mixture with pure milk . let w _ o be the amount of water in the mixture originally = 8 litres . let w _ r be the amount of water in the mixture after the replacements have taken place . then , { w _ r } / { w _ o } = ( 1 - r / m ) ^ n where r is the amount of the mixture replaced by milk in each of the steps , m is the total volume of the mixture and n is the number of times the cycle is repeated . hence , { w _ r } / { w _ o } = ( 1 / 2 ) ^ 2 = 1 / 4 therefore e , w _ r = { w _ o } / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2 litres . b

a clock store sold a certain clock to a collector for 30 percent more than the store had originally paid for the clock . when the collector tried to resell the clock to the store , the store bought it back at 60 percent of what the collector had paid . the shop then sold the clock again at a profit of 90 percent on its buy - back price . if the difference between the clock ' s original cost to the shop and the clock ' s buy - back price was $ 150 , for how much did the shop sell the clock the second time ?
Answer: $ 1010.46
Explanation: now , in the question above , lets say the original cost of the clock to store was c $ and then it sold the same to the collector at 30 % profit . this means the clocks ' selling price was c ( 1.3 ) and this becomes cost price for the collector . now , when the collector tries to sell the same clock to the store , the store buys it for 60 % the price at which the collector bought it . thus , you get = 1.3 * 0.6 * c = 0.78 c furthermore , the store sells the clock for the second time for 90 % profit and thus the selling price of the clock becomes = cost price of the clock for the store at buy - back * 1.9 = 1.9 * 0.78 c finally given that c - 0.78 c = 150 - - - - > c = 681.82 $ thus , the cost of the clock the second time around = 1.9 * 0.78 c = 1.9 * 0.78 * 681.82 = 1010.46 $ . hence a is the correct answer .

two dogsled teams raced across a 300 mile course in wyoming . team a finished the course in 3 fewer hours than team r . if team a ' s average speed was 5 mph greater than team r ' s , what was team r ' s average mph ?
Answer: 20
Explanation: this is a very specific format that has appeared in a handful of real gmat questions , and you may wish to learn to recognize it : here we have a * fixed * distance , and we are given the difference between the times and speeds of two things that have traveled that distance . this is one of the very small number of question formats where backsolving is typically easier than solving directly , since the direct approach normally produces a quadratic equation . say team r ' s speed was s . then team r ' s time is 300 / s . team a ' s speed was then s + 5 , and team a ' s time was then 300 / ( s + 5 ) . we need to find an answer choice for s so that the time of team a is 3 less than the time of team r . that is , we need an answer choice so that 300 / ( s + 5 ) = ( 300 / s ) - 3 . you can now immediately use number properties to zero in on promising answer choices : the times in these questions will always work out to be integers , and we need to divide 300 by s , and by s + 5 . so we want an answer choice s which is a factor of 300 , and for which s + 5 is also a factor of 300 . so you can rule out answers a and c immediately , since s + 5 wo n ' t be a divisor of 300 in those cases ( sometimes using number properties you get to the correct answer without doing any other work , but unfortunately that ' s not the case here ) . testing the other answer choices , if you try answer d , you find the time for team r is 15 hours , and for team a is 12 hours , and since these differ by 3 , as desired , d is correct .

each month a retailer sells 100 identical items . on each item he makes a profit of $ 30 that constitutes 10 % of the item ' s price to the retailer . if the retailer contemplates giving a 5 % discount on the items he sells , what is the least number of items he will have to sell each month to justify the policy of the discount ?
Answer: 223
Explanation: for this question , we ' ll need the following formula : sell price = cost + profit we ' re told that the profit on 1 item is $ 20 and that this represents 10 % of the cost : sell price = cost + $ 30 sell price = $ 300 + $ 30 thus , the sell price is $ 330 for each item . selling all 100 items gives the retailer . . . 100 ( $ 30 ) = $ 2,000 of profit if the retailer offers a 5 % discount on the sell price , then the equation changes . . . 5 % ( 330 ) = $ 16.5 discount $ 313.5 = $ 300 + $ 13.5 now , the retailer makes a profit of just $ 13.5 per item sold . to earn $ 2,000 in profit , the retailer must sell . . . . $ 13.5 ( x ) = $ 2,000 x = 2,000 / 13.5 x = 222.222222 items you ' ll notice that this is not among the answer choices . . . . 221 and 223 are . selling 221 items would get us 9 ( 221 ) = $ 1989 which is not enough money . to get back to at least $ 2,000 , we need to sell 223 items . final

' we ' re asked for the average of all of the multiples of 10 from 10 to 600 , inclusive . to start , we can figure out the total number of terms rather easily : 1 ( 10 ) = 10 2 ( 10 ) = 20 . . . 60 ( 10 ) = 600 so we know that there are 60 total numbers . we can now figure out the sum of those numbers with ' bunching ' : 10 + 600 = 610 20 + 590 = 610 30 + 580 = 610 etc . since there are 60 total terms , this pattern will create 30 ' pairs ' of 610 . thus , since the average = ( sum of terms ) / ( number of terms ) , we have . . . ( 30 ) ( 610 ) / ( 60 ) = 305 final

a part - time employee ’ s hourly wage was increased by 50 % . she decided to decrease the number of hours worked per week so that her total income did not change . by approximately what percent should the number of hours worked be decreased ?
Answer: 33 %
Explanation: let ' s plug in somenicenumbers and see what ' s needed . let ' s say the employee used to make $ 1 / hour and worked 100 hours / week so , the total weekly income was $ 100 / week after the 50 % wage increase , the employee makes $ 1.50 / hour we want the employee ' s income to remain at $ 100 / week . so , we want ( $ 1.50 / hour ) ( new # of hours ) = $ 100 divide both sides by 1.50 to get : new # of hours = 100 / 1.50 ≈ 67 hours so , the number of hours decreases from 100 hours to ( approximately ) 67 hours . this represents a 33 % decrease ( approximately ) .

the q train leaves station a moving at a constant speed , and passes by stations b and c , in this order . it takes the q train 7 hours to reach station b , and 5 additional hours to reach station c . the distance between stations a and b is m kilometers longer than the distance between stations b and c . what is the distance between stations a and c in terms of m ?
Answer: 6 m
Explanation: the reason it is failing for you is that you chose incorrect numbers . if the question says it q took 7 hrs to reach from a to b and 5 hrs to reach from b to c at a constant speed . it shows that distance ab and bc should be in ratio of 7 / 5 . if you take such numbers you can solve problem . ab = 7 , bc = 5 therefore ab - bc = 2 but from question , ab - bc = m = > m = 2 now total distance = ab + bc = 12 substitute 12 to get answer in terms of m total distance = 12 = 6 m ans b

a room is 6 meters 24 centimeters in length and 4 meters 32 centimeters in width . find the least number of square tiles of equal size required to cover the entire floor of the room .
Answer: 117
Explanation: let us calculate both the length and width of the room in centimeters . length = 6 meters and 24 centimeters = 624 cm width = 4 meters and 32 centimeters = 432 cm as we want the least number of square tiles required , it means the length of each square tile should be as large as possible . further , the length of each square tile should be a factor of both the length and width of the room . hence , the length of each square tile will be equal to the hcf of the length and width of the room = hcf of 624 and 432 = 48 thus , the number of square tiles required = ( 624 x 432 ) / ( 48 x 48 ) = 13 x 9 = 117

the speed of a railway engine is 96 km per hour when no compartment is attached , and the reduction in speed is directly proportional to the square root of the number of compartments attached . if the speed of the train carried by this engine is 24 km per hour when 9 compartments are attached , the maximum number of compartments that can be carried by the engine is :
Answer: 16
Explanation: the reduction in speed is directly proportional to the square root of the number of compartments attached doesreductionmean amount subtracted ? or percentage decrease ? there are at least two interpretations , and the wording does not provide a clear interpretation between them . evidently what the question intends is the subtraction interpretation . what is subtracted from the speed is directly proportional to the square root of the number of compartments attached . in other words , if s = speed , and n = number of compartments , then s = 42 - k * sqrt ( n ) wherekis a constant of the proportionality . in general , if a is directly proportional to b , we can write a = k * b and solve for k . if n = 9 , then s = 24 24 = 96 - k * sqrt ( 9 ) = 96 - 3 k k = 24 now , we need to know : what value of n makes s go to zero ? 0 = 96 - 24 * sqrt ( n ) 24 * sqrt ( n ) = 96 sqrt ( n ) = 4 n = 4 ^ 2 = 16 thus , 16 is the maximum number of cars the engine can pull and still move . c

a ’ s speed is 32 / 27 times that of b . if a and b run a race , what part of the length of the race should a give b as a head start , so that the race ends in a dead heat ?
Answer: 5 / 32
Explanation: we have the ratio of a ’ s speed and b ’ s speed . this means , we know how much distance a covers compared with b in the same time . this is what the beginning of the race will look like : ( start ) a _________ b ______________________________ if a covers 32 meters , b covers 27 meters in that time . so if the race is 32 meters long , when a reaches the finish line , b would be 5 meters behind him . if we want the race to end in a dead heat , we want b to be at the finish line too at the same time . this means b should get a head start of 5 meters so that he doesn ’ t need to cover that . in that case , the time required by a ( to cover 32 meters ) would be the same as the time required by b ( to cover 27 meters ) to reach the finish line . so b should get a head start of 5 / 32 th of the race . answer ( a )

in a graduating class , the difference between the highest and lowest salaries is $ 100000 . the median salary is $ 50000 higher than the lowest salary and the average salary is $ 20000 higher than the median . what is the minimum number of students e in the class ?
Answer: c ) 15
Explanation: the difference between the highest and lowest salaries is $ 100000 . so there are at least 2 people - say one with salary 0 and the other with 100 k . no salary will be outside this range . median = 50 k more than lowest . so median is right in the center of lowest and highest since lowest and highest differ by 100 k . in our example , median = 50 k . since there are more than 2 people , there would probably be a person at 50 k . mean = 20 k more than median so in our example , mean salary = 70 k on the number line , 0 . . . . . . . . 50 k ( median ) . . . . . . . . 100 k mean = 70 k so there must be people more toward 100 k to bring the mean up to 70 k . since we want to add minimum people , we will add people at 100 k to quickly make up the right side deficit . 0 and 50 k are ( 70 k + 20 k ) = 90 k away from 70 k . 100 k is 30 k away from 70 k . to bring the mean to 70 k , we will add two people at 100 k each to get : 0 . . . . 50 k . . . . . 100 k , 100 k , 100 k but when we add more people to the right of 70 k , the median will shift to the right . we need to keep the median at 50 k . so every time we add people to the right of 70 k , we need to add people at 50 k too to balance the median . 50 k is 20 k less than 70 k while 100 k is 30 k more than 70 k . to keep the mean same , we need to add 2 people at 100 k for every 3 people we add at 50 k . so if we add 3 people at 50 k and 2 people at 100 k , we get : 0 , . . . 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , . . . 100 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k the median is not at 50 k yet . add another 3 people at 50 k and another 2 at 100 k to get 0 , 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , 50 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k , 100 k now the median is 50 k and mean is 70 k . total number of people is 15 . answer ( c )

Explanation: we have the ratio of a ’ s speed and b ’ s speed . this means , we know how much distance a covers compared with b in the same time . this is what the beginning of the race will look like : ( start ) a _________ b ______________________________ if a covers 20 meters , b covers 15 meters in that time . so if the race is 20 meters long , when a reaches the finish line , b would be 5 meters behind him . if we want the race to end in a dead heat , we want b to be at the finish line too at the same time . this means b should get a head start of 5 meters so that he doesn ’ t need to cover that . in that case , the time required by a ( to cover 20 meters ) would be the same as the time required by b ( to cover 15 meters ) to reach the finish line . so b should get a head start of 5 / 20 th of the race . answer ( d )

a vendor buys 10 t - shirts at an average price of $ 14 per t - shirt . he then buys 15 more t - shirts at an average price of $ 11 per t - shirt . what is the average price d per t - shirt that the vendor paid for these purchases ?
Answer: $ 12.20
Explanation: correct answer : a explanation : the relevant formula for this problem is average d = ( sum ) / ( number of terms ) . another way to look at the formula is sum = average x number of terms . for the first purchase , the vendor ' s sum ( total cost ) was $ 140 , since 14 x 10 = 140 . for the second purchase , the vendor ' s cost was $ 165 , since 11 x 15 = 165 . the grand sum is then $ 140 + $ 165 , which equals $ 305 . the total number of shirts purchased was 25 , so to get the average price per shirt , we divide 305 by 25 , which equals $ 12.20 . as a result , the correct answer is a . note : a relative understanding of weighted average offers a shortcut to this problem . because the true average of 11 and 14 is 12.5 , but the vendor sells more shirts at the lower price than at the higher price , the weighted average must be less than $ 12.50 ; only answer choice a is a possibility .

how many diagonals does a 61 - sided convex polygon have ?
Answer: 1769
Explanation: a 61 - sided convex polygon has 61 vertices . if we examine a single vertex , we can see that we can connect it with 58 other vertices to create a diagonal . note that we ca n ' t connect the vertex to itself and we ca n ' t connect it to its adjacent vertices , since this would not create a diagonal . if each of the 61 vertices can be connected with 58 vertices to create a diagonal then the total number of diagonals would be ( 61 ) ( 58 ) = 3538 however , we must recognize that we have counted every diagonal twice . to account for counting each diagonal twice , we must divide 3538 by 2 to get 1769 . the answer is b .

balls of equal size are arranged in rows to form an equilateral triangle . the top most row consists of one ball , the 2 nd row of two balls and so on . if 253 balls are added , then all the balls can be arranged in the shape of square and each of the sides of the square contain 8 balls less than the each side of the triangle did . how many balls made up the triangle ?
Answer: 903
Explanation: as expected , this question boils down to 2 equation , consider total number of balls in triangle = t and number of balls in last row = x . 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + x = t x ( x + 1 ) / 2 = t - - - - ( a ) as mentioned in the question , side of a square will be ( x - 8 ) and total number of balls in square will be ( t + 253 ) ( x - 8 ) ^ 2 = t + 253 - - - - - ( b ) now the hardest part of the question will be to solve these 2 equations and this looks like time consuming but the easy way will be plug and play . also , we ' ve to find a value of t ( from 5 optiosn given below ) which can make a square of a a number . one we know this , it will be a cake walk . we can see that option a fits this criteria in eq ( b ) . add - 903 + 253 = 1156 = 34 ^ 2 = ( x - 8 ) ^ 2 hence , x = 42 . cross check by putting in eq ( a ) = x ( x + 1 ) / 2 = t = > 42 * 43 / 2 = 903 hence , answer is a .

a children ' s gift store sells gift certificates in denominations of $ 3 and $ 5 . the store sold ' m ' $ 3 certificates and ' n ' $ 5 certificates worth $ 93 on a saturday afternoon . if ' m ' and ' n ' are natural numbers , how many different values can ' m ' take ?
Answer: 6
Explanation: explanatory answer step 1 : key data 1 . total value of all certificates sold = $ 93 . 2 . certificates sold were in denominations of $ 3 and $ 5 . 3 . both ' m ' and ' n ' are natural numbers . step 2 : approach the value of all certificates sold , 93 is divisible by 3 . so , a maximum of 31 $ 3 certificates and no $ 5 certificates could have been sold . however , the question states that both ' m ' and ' n ' are natural numbers . hence , at least 1 $ 5 certificate should have been sold . let us reduce the number of $ 3 certificates from theoretical maximum count of 31 by say ' x ' and correspondingly increase $ 5 certificates by ' y ' . evidently , 3 x = 5 y because the value of $ 3 certificates reduced should be the same as the value of $ 5 certificates increased . it means that x has to be a multiple of 5 and y has to be a multiple of 3 . or $ 3 certificates reduce in steps of 5 certificates . step 3 : list down possibilities the following combinations are possible 1 . m = 26 , n = 3 2 . m = 21 , n = 6 3 . m = 16 , n = 9 4 . m = 11 , n = 12 5 . m = 6 , n = 15 6 . m = 1 , n = 18 an alternative way to think of the same concept - replacing five $ 3 certificates with three $ 5 certificates leads to no change in the overall value of certficates sold and gives us a new combination each time . we need to see how many such combinations are possible . answer c

a sum of money is to be divided among ann , bob and chloe . first , ann receives $ 4 plus one - half of what remains . next , bob receives $ 4 plus one - third of what remains . finally , chloe receives the remaining $ 32 . how much money m did bob receive ?
Answer: 22
Explanation: notice that we need not consider ann ' s portion in the solution . we can just let k = the money remaining after ann has received her portion and go from there . our equation will use the fact that , once we remove bob ' s portion , we have $ 32 for chloe . so , we getk - bob ' s $ = 32 bob received 4 dollars plus one - third of what remained once bob receives $ 4 , the amount remaining is k - 4 dollars . so , bob gets a 1 / 3 of that as well . 1 / 3 of k - 4 is ( k - 4 ) / 3 so altogether , bob receives 4 + ( k - 4 ) / 3 so , our equation becomes : k - [ 4 + ( k - 4 ) / 3 ] = 32 simplify to get : k - 4 - ( k - 4 ) / 3 = 32 multiply both sides by 3 to get : 3 k - 12 - k + 4 = 96 simplify : 2 k - 8 = 96 solve : k = 52 plug this k - value intok - bob ' s $ = 32 to get : 52 - bob ' s $ = 32 so , bob ' s $ m = 20

Explanation: make sure to follow posting guidelines ( link in my signatures ) . title of the thread must mention the first few words of the question itself . as for the question , the most straightforward way is to list out the factors ( this is fine for this question as 180 is a relatively small number ) . number of factors of 180 ( = 2 ^ 2 * 3 ^ 2 * 5 ) = 18 . so listing the factors gives us : 1 , 180 2 , 90 3 , 60 4 , 45 5 , 36 6 , 30 9 , 20 10 , 18 12 , 15 as the question asks us about the factors of the form 4 k + 2 - - - > eliminate all odd factors . you are now left with 24 , 610 , 1218 , 2030 , 3660 , 90180 for the form 4 k + 2 , the first few values are 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , 26 , 30 . . . already giving you 5 factors ( = 2 , 610 , 1830 ) . you can stop here and mark 6 ( 6 th one = 90 ) as the correct answer as 5 is not given . for checking any particular factor whether they conform to the form 4 k + 2 - - - > do the following 4 k + 2 = 36 - - - > 4 k = 34 - - > this will not give you an integer value for k - - - > reject . proceed with others until you find all the values asked . e is thus the correct answer .

a set of consecutive positive integers beginning with 1 is written on the blackboard . a student came along and erased one number . the average of the remaining numbers is 35 7 / 17 . what was the number erased ?
Answer: seven 7
Explanation: 2 ) the average of the new group of numbers is 35 7 / 17 . the denominator of that fraction tells us that the total number of terms in the new list must be a multiple of 17 : 17 , 34 , 51 , 68 , 85 , etc . 3 ) since we ' re removing 1 number from a list of consecutive positive integers , we could quickly limit down the possible number of terms in the original list : if new = 17 , old = 18 , but the numbers from 1 to 18 would not have an average in the mid - 30 s ( it would be much smaller ) . eliminate this option . if new = 34 , old = 35 , but we run into the same problem . the average wo n ' t match here either . eliminate this option . if new = 51 , old = 52 , same problem here . eliminate this option . if new = 68 , old = 69 . . . . here we have a group of numbers that might just be what we ' re looking for . in theold group , the average is themiddle term = 35 , which is really close to the new average once we remove a number . now , we just have to figure out which of the 5 answers was removed ( and that changed the new average to 35 7 / 17 ) . there are a couple of ways to do this math , but i ' m going to use the answers to save myself some steps : sum of 1 to 69 , inclusive = 69 ( 35 ) = 2415 remove answer b . . . . 2415 - 8 = 2407 new average = 2407 / 68 = 35 27 / 68 now , we can compare 27 / 68 to 7 / 17 27 / 68 and 28 / 68 this is really close , but is not the answer . eliminate b . the answer is either a or c . since 28 / 68 is a bigger fraction than 27 / 68 , we need the sum ( of the 68 integers ) to be bigger . . . which means we need to remove a smaller number . final

a lady grows cauliflower in her garden that is in the shape of a square . each cauliflower takes 1 square foot of area in her garden . this year , she has increased her output by 223 cauliflower when compared to last year . the shape of the area used for growing the cauliflower has remained a square in both these years . how many cauliflowers did she produce this year ?
Answer: C
Explanation: explanatory answer the shape of the area used for growing cauliflower has remained a square in both the years . let the side of the square area used for growing cauliflower this year be x ft . therefore , the area of the ground used for cultivation this year = x 2 sq . ft . let the side of the square area used for growing cauliflower last year be y ft . therefore , the area of the ground used for cultivation last year = y 2 sq . ft . as the number of cauliflower grown has increased by 223 , the area would have increased by 223 sq ft because each cauliflower takes 1 sq ft space . hence , x 2 - y 2 = 223 ( x + y ) ( x - y ) = 223 . 223 is a prime number and hence it will have only two factors . i . e . , 223 and 1 . therefore , 223 can be expressed as product of 2 numbers in only way = 223 * 1 i . e . , ( x + y ) ( x - y ) = 223 * 1 so , ( x + y ) should be 223 and ( x - y ) should be 1 . solving the two equations we get x = 112 and y = 111 . therefore , number of cauliflower produced this year = x 2 = 1122 = 12544 . alternative approach : use answer choices the area in both the years are squares of two numbers . that rules out choice a , b and d . as 12541,12542 and 12545 are not the square of any number . check choice c : if this year ' s produce is 12544 , last year ' s produce would have been 12544 - 223 = 12321 12321 is the square of 111 . so , 12544 is the answer . choice c .

Answer: 360 / 7
Explanation: let the distances between city a to b and b to c be x km and 2 x km respectively . total time taken to cover from a to c = ( x ) / 40 + ( 2 x ) / 60 = ( 3 x + 4 x ) / 120 = 7 x / 120 average speed = ( x + 2 x ) / ( 7 x / 120 ) = 360 / 7 kmph .

a ’ s speed is 30 / 17 times that of b . if a and b run a race , what part of the length of the race should a give b as a head start , so that the race ends in a dead heat ?
Answer: 13 / 30
Explanation: we have the ratio of a ’ s speed and b ’ s speed . this means , we know how much distance a covers compared with b in the same time . this is what the beginning of the race will look like : ( start ) a _________ b ______________________________ if a covers 30 meters , b covers 17 meters in that time . so if the race is 30 meters long , when a reaches the finish line , b would be 13 meters behind him . if we want the race to end in a dead heat , we want b to be at the finish line too at the same time . this means b should get a head start of 13 meters so that he doesn ’ t need to cover that . in that case , the time required by a ( to cover 30 meters ) would be the same as the time required by b ( to cover 17 meters ) to reach the finish line . so b should get a head start of 13 / 30 th of the race . answer ( b )

a clock store sold a certain clock to a collector for 15 percent more than the store had originally paid for the clock . when the collector tried to resell the clock to the store , the store bought it back at 45 percent of what the collector had paid . the shop then sold the clock again at a profit of 85 percent on its buy - back price . if the difference between the clock ' s original cost to the shop and the clock ' s buy - back price was $ 80 , for how much did the shop sell the clock the second time ?
Answer: $ 158.74
Explanation: now , in the question above , lets say the original cost of the clock to store was c $ and then it sold the same to the collector at 15 % profit . this means the clocks ' selling price was c ( 1.15 ) and this becomes cost price for the collector . now , when the collector tries to sell the same clock to the store , the store buys it for 45 % the price at which the collector bought it . thus , you get = 1.15 * 0.45 * c = 0.5175 c furthermore , the store sells the clock for the second time for 85 % profit and thus the selling price of the clock becomes = cost price of the clock for the store at buy - back * 1.85 = 1.85 * 0.5175 c finally given that c - 0.5175 c = 80 - - - - > c = 165.80 $ thus , the cost of the clock the second time around = 1.85 * 0.5175 c = 1.85 * 0.5175 * 165.80 = 158.74 $ . hence c is the correct answer .

a clock store sold a certain clock to a collector for 25 percent more than the store had originally paid for the clock . when the collector tried to resell the clock to the store , the store bought it back at 55 percent of what the collector had paid . the shop then sold the clock again at a profit of 70 percent on its buy - back price . if the difference between the clock ' s original cost to the shop and the clock ' s buy - back price was $ 125 , for how much did the shop sell the clock the second time ?
Answer: $ 467.5
Explanation: now , in the question above , lets say the original cost of the clock to store was c $ and then it sold the same to the collector at 25 % profit . this means the clocks ' selling price was c ( 1.25 ) and this becomes cost price for the collector . now , when the collector tries to sell the same clock to the store , the store buys it for 55 % the price at which the collector bought it . thus , you get = 1.25 * 0.55 * c = 0.6875 c furthermore , the store sells the clock for the second time for 70 % profit and thus the selling price of the clock becomes = cost price of the clock for the store at buy - back * 1.7 = 1.7 * 0.6875 c finally given that c - 0.6875 c = 125 - - - - > c = 400 $ thus , the cost of the clock the second time around = 1.7 * 0.6875 c = 1.7 * 0.6875 * 400 = 467.5 $ . hence b is the correct answer .

maths , physics and chemistry books are stored on a library shelf that can accommodate 25 books . currently , 20 % of the shelf spots remain empty . there are twice as many maths books as physics books and the number of physics books is 4 greater than that of chemistry books . among all the books , 12 books are soft cover and the remaining are hard - cover . if there are a total of 7 hard - cover books among the maths and physics books . what is the probability e , that a book selected at random is either a hard cover book or a chemistry book ?
Answer: 9 / 20
Explanation: first phase of this problem requires you to determine how many mathematics and chemistry books are even on the shelf . to do so , you have the equations : m + p + c = 20 ( since 4 / 5 of the 25 spots are full of books ) m = 2 p p = 4 + c from that , you can use substitution to get everything down to one variable . c = p - 4 m = 2 p p = p then ( p - 4 ) + 2 p + p = 20 , so 4 p = 24 and p = 6 . that means that there are 12 math , 6 physics , and 2 chemistry books on the shelf . with those numbers , you also know that there are 8 total hardcovers , 1 of which is chemistry . so if your goal is to get either a hardcover or a chemistry , there are 9 ways towin - either one of the 7 hardcovers that are n ' t chemistry or the two chemistry books . so out of the 20 total , e = 9 provide the desired outcome , making the answer e .

a train traveling at 180 kmph crosses a platform in 30 seconds and a man standing on the platform in 12 seconds . what is the length of the platform in meters ?
Answer: 600 meters
Explanation: answer distance covered by the train when crossing a man and when crossing a platform when a train crosses a man standing on a platform , the distance covered by the train is equal to the length of the train . however , when the same train crosses a platform , the distance covered by the train is equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform . the extra time that the train takes when crossing the platform is on account of the extra distance that it has to cover . i . e . , length of the platform . compute length of platform length of the platform = speed of train * extra time taken to cross the platform . length of platform = 180 kmph * 12 seconds convert 180 kmph into m / sec 1 kmph = 5 / 18 m / s ( this can be easily derived . but if you can remember this conversion , it saves a good 30 seconds ) . ∴ 180 kmph = 5 / 18 ∗ 180 = 50 m / sec therefore , length of the platform = 50 m / s * 12 sec = 600 meters . choice d

the speeds of three asteroids were compared . asteroids x - 13 and y - 14 were observed for identical durations , while asteroid z - 15 was observed for 2 seconds longer . during its period of observation , asteroid y - 14 traveled three times the distance x - 13 traveled , and therefore y - 14 was found to be faster than x - 13 by 8000 kilometers per second . asteroid z - 15 had an identical speed as that of x - 13 , but because z - 15 was observed for a longer period , it traveled five times the distance x - 13 traveled during x - 13 ' s inspection . asteroid x - 13 traveled how many kilometers during its observation ?
Answer: E
Explanation: x 13 : ( t , d , s ) y 14 : ( t , 3 d , s + 8000 mi / hour ) z 15 : ( t + 2 seconds , s , 5 d ) d = ? distance = speed * time x 13 : d = s * t x 14 : 3 d = ( s + 8000 ) * t = = = > 3 d = ts + 8000 t z 15 : 5 d = s * ( t + 2 t ) = = = > 5 d = st + 2 st = = = > 5 d - 2 st = st 3 d = 5 d - 2 st + 8000 t - 2 d = - 2 st + 8000 t 2 d = 2 st - 8000 t d = st - 4000 t x 13 : d = s * t st - 4000 t = s * t s - 4000 = s - 2000 = s i got to this point and could n ' t go any further . this seems like a problem where i can set up individual d = r * t formulas and solve but it appears that ' s not the case . for future reference how would i know not to waste my time setting up this problem in the aforementioned way ? thanks ! ! ! the distance of z 15 is equal to five times the distance of x 13 ( we established that x 13 is the baseline and thus , it ' s measurements are d , s , t ) s ( t + 2 ) = 5 ( s * t ) what clues would i have to know to set up the equation in this fashion ? is it because i am better off setting two identical distances together ? st + 2 s = 5 st t + 2 = 5 t 2 = 4 t t = 1 / 2 we are looking for distance ( d = s * t ) so we need to solve for speed now that we have time . speed y 14 - speed x 13 speed = d / t 3 d / t - d / t = 8000 ( remember , t is the same because both asteroids were observed for the same amount of time ) 2 d = 8000 2 = 4000 d = s * t d = 4000 * ( 1 / 2 ) d = 2000

a not - so - good clockmaker has four clocks on display in the window . clock # 1 loses 10 minutes every hour . clock # 2 gains 15 minutes every hour relative to clock # 1 ( i . e . , as clock # 1 moves from 12 : 00 to 1 : 00 , clock # 2 moves from 12 : 00 to 1 : 15 ) . clock # 3 loses 20 minutes every hour relative to clock # 2 . finally , clock # 4 gains 20 minutes every hour relative to clock # 3 . if the clockmaker resets all four clocks to the correct time at 12 noon , what time will clock # 4 display after 6 actual hours ( when it is actually 6 : 00 pm that same day ) ?
Answer: 6 : 00
Explanation: c 1 loses 15 minutes every hour . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 1 displays that 60 - 15 = 45 minutes have passed . c 2 gains 15 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 1 . thus , the time displayed on c 2 is 75 / 60 = 5 / 4 the time displayed on c 1 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 2 displays the passing of ( 5 / 4 * 45 ) minutes . c 3 loses 20 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 2 . thus , the time displayed on c 3 is 40 / 60 = 2 / 3 the time displayed on c 2 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 3 displays the passing of ( 2 / 3 * 5 / 4 * 45 ) minutes . c 4 gains 20 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 3 . thus , the time displayed on c 4 is 80 / 60 = 4 / 3 the time displayed on clock 3 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 4 displays the passing of 4 / 3 * 2 / 3 * 5 / 4 * 45 = 50 minutes . c 4 loses 10 minutes every hour . in 6 hours , c 4 will lose 6 * 10 = 60 minutes = 1 hour . since the correct time after 6 hours will be 6 pm , c 4 will show a time of 6 - 1 = 6 pm . the correct answer is d .

a not - so - good clockmaker has four clocks on display in the window . clock # 1 loses 17 minutes every hour . clock # 2 gains 15 minutes every hour relative to clock # 1 ( i . e . , as clock # 1 moves from 12 : 00 to 1 : 00 , clock # 2 moves from 12 : 00 to 1 : 15 ) . clock # 3 loses 20 minutes every hour relative to clock # 2 . finally , clock # 4 gains 20 minutes every hour relative to clock # 3 . if the clockmaker resets all four clocks to the correct time at 12 noon , what time will clock # 4 display after 6 actual hours ( when it is actually 6 : 00 pm that same day ) ?
Answer: 5 : 34
Explanation: c 1 loses 15 minutes every hour . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 1 displays that 60 - 15 = 45 minutes have passed . c 2 gains 15 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 1 . thus , the time displayed on c 2 is 75 / 60 = 5 / 4 the time displayed on c 1 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 2 displays the passing of ( 5 / 4 * 45 ) minutes . c 3 loses 20 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 2 . thus , the time displayed on c 3 is 40 / 60 = 2 / 3 the time displayed on c 2 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 3 displays the passing of ( 2 / 3 * 5 / 4 * 45 ) minutes . c 4 gains 20 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 3 . thus , the time displayed on c 4 is 80 / 60 = 4 / 3 the time displayed on clock 3 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 4 displays the passing of 4 / 3 * 2 / 3 * 5 / 4 * 45 = 50 minutes . c 4 loses 10 minutes every hour . in 6 hours , c 4 will lose 6 * 10 = 60 minutes = 1 hour . since the correct time after 6 hours will be 6 pm , c 4 will show a time of 6 - 1 = 5 : 34 pm . the correct answer is b .

a technology company made a $ 5 million profit on its first $ 15 million in sales and a $ 12 million profit on its next $ 30 million in sales . by what percent did the ratio of profit to sales increase from the first $ 15 million in sales to the next $ 30 million in sales ?
Answer: 20 %
Explanation: solution : this is a percent increase problem . we will use the formula : percent change = ( new – old ) / old x 100 to calculate the final answer . we first set up the ratios of profits to sales . the first ratio will be for the first 15 million in sales , and the second ratio will be for the next 30 million in sales . because all of the sales are in millions , we do not have to express all the trailing zeros in our ratios . first 15 million profit / sales = 5 / 15 = 1 / 3 next 30 million profit / sales = 12 / 30 = 2 / 5 we can simplify each ratio by multiplying each by the lcm of the two denominators , which is 15 . keep in mind that we are able to do this only because our answer choices are expressed in percents . first 15 million royalties / sales = ( 1 / 3 ) x 15 = 5 next 30 million royalties / sales = ( 2 / 5 ) x 15 = 6 we can plug 5 and 6 into our percent change formula : ( new – old ) / old x 100 [ ( 6 – 5 ) / 5 ] x 100 1 / 5 x 100 , so a 20 % increase . answer b .

a car drives 60 miles on local roads at 30 mph , and 65 miles on the highway at 65 mph , what is the average speed of the entire trip ?
Answer: 42 mph
Explanation: so the answer is plainly d . . . . we have a general relation for speed , time and distance : v ( velocity ) * t ( time ) = d ( distance ) for first part we have d = 60 miles , and v = 30 mph so we can obtain time : 30 * t = 60 or t = 60 / 30 = 2 hours the needed time to cover 60 miles in the same way we should divide 65 by 65 to find the needed time to cover 65 miles , so t = 1 hours so the total time for covering total distance would be 2 + 1 = 3 hours and total distance is 60 + 65 = 125 miles final stage : average speed is total distance divide to total time : 125 / 3 = 41.6 miles per hour that rounds up to 42 . . . .

solution a is 20 % salt and solution b is 70 % salt . if you have 30 ounces of solution a and 60 ounces of solution b , in what ratio could you mix solution a with solution b to produce 50 ounces of a 50 % salt solution ?
Answer: 2 : 3
Explanation: forget the volumes for the time being . you have to mix 20 % and 80 % solutions to get 50 % . this is very straight forward since 50 is int he middle of 20 and 80 so we need both solutions in equal quantities . if this does n ' t strike , use w 1 / w 2 = ( a 2 - aavg ) / ( aavg - a 1 ) w 1 / w 2 = ( 70 - 50 ) / ( 50 - 20 ) = 2 / 3 so the volume of the two solutions will be equal . answer has to be 2 : 3 c

what is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality ( x - 3 ) / ( x ^ 2 - 8 x - 20 ) > 0 > 0 ?
Answer: - 1
Explanation: explanatory answer let us factorize the denominator and rewrite the expression as x − 3 / ( x − 10 ) ( x + 2 ) > 0 equate each of the terms of the expression to zero to identify the values of x that are relevant to test whether the inequality holds good . the values that are relevant to us are x = 3 , x = 10 and x = - 2 . let us arrange these values in ascending order : - 2 , 3 and 10 . the quickest way to solve inequalities questions after arriving at these values is verifying whether the inequality holds good at the following intervals . interval 1 : x < - 2 . pick a value in that range and check whether the inequality holds good . let us take x = - 10 . when x = - 10 , x − 3 / ( x − 10 ) ( x + 2 ) < 0 ; the inequality does not hold good in this interval . interval 2 : - 2 < x < 3 . let us take x = 0 . when x = 0 , x − 3 / ( x − 10 ) ( x + 2 ) = 0 − 3 / ( 0 − 10 ) ( 0 + 2 ) > 0 ; the inequality holds good in this interval . the least integer value that x can take if x > - 2 is x = - 1 . so , the correct answer is - 1 . choice d . remember : we have to find out the least integer value . and we have arrived at - 1 . do , not waste time computing the entire range of values of x that satisfy the inequality . note : in any inequality question , when the question asks us to determine the intervals in which the inequality holds good , we have to eliminate values of x that will result in the denominator becoming zero . choice d

a man cheats while buying as well as while selling . while buying he takes 10 % more than what he pays for and while selling he gives 20 % less than what he claims to . find the profit percent , if he sells at 13 % below the cost price of the claimed weight .
Answer: 19.63 %
Explanation: there is a one step calculation method too . it requires more thought but is faster . the man takes 10 % more than what he pays for . so if he claims to take 100 pounds , he pays $ 100 but he actually takes 110 pounds for which he will take from the customer $ 110 . hence , in effect , there is a 10 % mark up . while selling , he sells 20 % less . this means , he claims to sell 100 pounds and gets $ 100 but actually sells only 80 pounds and should have got only $ 80 for it . so this is again a mark up of $ 20 on $ 80 which is 25 % . but he also sells at 13 % less ( 1 + m 1 % ) ( 1 + m 2 % ) ( 1 - d % ) = ( 1 + p % ) 11 / 10 * 5 / 4 * 87 / 100 = ( 1 + p % ) profit % = 19.63 % a

Explanation: explanatory answer step 1 : assign variables and frame equations let jose take ' x ' days to complete the task if he worked alone . let jane take ' y ' days to complete the task if she worked alone . statement 1 of the question : they will complete the task in 20 days , if they worked together . in 1 day , jose will complete 1 / x of the task . in 1 day , jane will complete 1 / yof the task . together , in 1 day they will complete 1 / 20 of the task . therefore , 1 / x + 1 / y = 1 / 20 . . . . ( 1 ) statement 2 of the question : if jose worked alone and completed half the work and then jane takes over and completes the second half , the task will be completed in 45 days . jose will complete half the task in x / 2 days . jane will complete half the task in y / 2 days . ∴ x / 2 + y / 2 = 45 or , x + y = 90 or x = 90 - y . . . . ( 2 ) step 2 : solve the two equations and find x and y substitute the value of x as ( 90 - y ) in the first equation 1 / 90 − y + 1 / y = 1 / 20 or y 2 - 90 + 1800 = 0 . the quadratic equation factorizes as ( y - 60 ) ( y - 30 ) = 0 so , y = 60 or y = 30 . if y = 60 , then x = 90 - y = 90 - 60 = 30 and if y = 30 , then x = 90 - y = 90 - 30 = 60 . the question clearly states that jane is more efficient than jose . therefore , jane will take lesser time than jose . hence , jose will take 60 days to complete the task if he worked alone and jane will take 30 days to complete the same task . choice c

the two lines y = x and x = - 4 intersect on the coordinate plane . if z represents the area of the figure formed by the intersecting lines and the x - axis , what is the side length r of a cube whose surface area is equal to 6 z ?
Answer: r = 2 √ 2
Explanation: 800 score official solution : the first step to solving this problem is to actually graph the two lines . the lines intersect at the point ( - 4 , - 4 ) and form a right triangle whose base length and height are both equal to 4 . as you know , the area of a triangle is equal to one half the product of its base length and height : a = ( 1 / 2 ) bh = ( 1 / 2 ) ( 4 × 4 ) = 8 ; so z = 8 . the next step requires us to find the length of a side of a cube that has a face area equal to 8 . as you know the 6 faces of a cube are squares . so , we can reduce the problem to finding the length of the side of a square that has an area of 8 . since the area of a square is equal to s ² , where s is the length of one of its side , we can write and solve the equation s ² = 8 . clearly s = √ 8 = 2 √ 2 , oranswer choice ( d ) .

if a rectangular billboard has an area of 104 square feet and a perimeter of 42 feet , what is the length of each of the shorter sides ?
Answer: C
Explanation: assume the sides to be x and y . perimeter = 2 x + 2 y = 42 hence x + y = 21 - ( i ) area = xy = 104 - ( ii ) since these are the sides of a billboard , we are dealing with positive numbers only and the options tell us that they are integers . 104 can be written as a product of two numbers as 104 * 1 or 52 * 2 or 26 * 4 or 13 * 8 of these , only 13 * 8 satisfies the equation ( i ) hence the lengths are 13 and 8 length of shorter side = 8

a number is increased by 50 % and then decreased by 50 % . find the net increase or decrease per cent .
Answer: 25 %
Explanation: let the number be 100 . increase in the number = 50 % = 50 % of 100 = ( 50 / 100 ã — 100 ) = 50 therefore , increased number = 100 + 50 = 150 this number is decreased by 50 % therefore , decrease in number = 50 % of 150 = ( 50 / 100 ã — 150 ) = 7500 / 100 = 75 therefore , new number = 150 - 75 = 75 thus , net decreases = 100 - 75 = 25 hence , net percentage decrease = ( 25 / 100 ã — 100 ) % = ( 2500 / 100 ) % = 25 %

in goshawk - eurasian nature reserve 30 percent of the birds are hawks , and 40 percent of the non - hawks are paddyfield - warblers . if there are 25 percent as many kingfishers as paddyfield - warblers in the reserve , then what percent of the birds b in the nature reserve are not hawks , paddyfield - warblers , or kingfishers ?
Answer: 35 %
Explanation: 1 . we are given the following percentages : 30 ( 70 ) , 40 ( 60 ) , 25 ( 75 ) . there are two threads from here . first starts at 30 % and finishes there . second one starts at 70 , then 40 , and then 25 . we need a value that is divisible by 7 , 2 , and 5 at least once . lets pick a number now , say 700 . so say if non hawks are 700 ( this is 70 % of the total , so total = 1000 ) , then paddy warbs are 2 / 5 x 700 = 1400 / 5 = 280 . kingfishers , therefore , are 280 / 4 = 70 . lets add them up . 300 hawks + 280 peddy warbs + 70 kingsifhers = 650 . so all others are 1000 - 650 = 350 or 35 % of total birds . the main job here to to identify the smart number to start the question with . this can be time consuming , but once identified , this question can be solved fairly quickly . 2 . another method : if x is total - - > non hawks = 0.7 x - - > warbs = 0.4 ( 0.7 x ) - - > kfs = 0.25 ( 0.4 ( 0.7 x ) ) . our job is to find out b : ( 0.3 x + 0.28 x + 0.07 x ) / x . or 0.65 x / x = 0.65 . we need to find 1 - 0.65 = 0.35 or 35 % . b

the distance between towns a and b is 300 km . one train departs from town a and another train departs from town b , both leaving at the same moment of time and heading towards each other . we know that one of them is 10 km / hr faster than the other . find the speeds of both trains if 2 hours after their departure the distance between them is 40 km .
Answer: 90
Explanation: let the speed of the slower train be xx km / hr . then the speed of the faster train is ( x + 10 ) ( x + 10 ) km / hr . in 2 hours they cover 2 x 2 x km and 2 ( x + 10 ) 2 ( x + 10 ) km , respectively . therefore if they did n ' t meet yet , the whole distance from a to b is 2 x + 2 ( x + 10 ) + 40 = 4 x + 602 x + 2 ( x + 10 ) + 40 = 4 x + 60 km . however , if they already met and continued to move , the distance would be 2 x + 2 ( x + 10 ) − 40 = 4 x − 202 x + 2 ( x + 10 ) − 40 = 4 x − 20 km . so we get the following equations : 4 x + 60 = 3004 x + 60 = 300 4 x = 2404 x = 240 x = 60 x = 60 or 4 x − 20 = 3004 x − 20 = 300 4 x = 3204 x = 320 x = 80 x = 80 hence the speed of the slower train is 60 km / hr or 80 km / hr and the speed of the faster train is 70 km / hr or 90 km / hr .

n and m are each 3 - digit integers . each of the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 45 and 6 is a digit of either n or m . what is the smallest possible positive difference between n and m ?
Answer: 49
Explanation: you have 6 digits : 12 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 each digit needs to be used to make two 3 digit numbers . this means that we will use each of the digits only once and in only one of the numbers . the numbers need to be as close to each other as possible . the numbers can not be equal so the greater number needs to be as small as possible and the smaller number needs to be as large as possible to be close to each other . the first digit ( hundreds digit ) of both numbers should be consecutive integers now let ' s think about the next digit ( the tens digit ) . to minimize the difference between the numbers , the tens digit of the greater number should be as small as possible and the tens digit of the smaller number should be as large as possible . so let ' s not use 1 and 6 in the hundreds places and reserve them for the tens places now what are the options ? try and make a pair with ( 2 * * and 3 * * ) . make the 2 * * number as large as possible and make the 3 * * number as small as possible . 265 and 314 ( difference is 49 ) or try and make a pair with ( 4 * * and 5 * * ) . make the 4 * * number as large as possible and make the 5 * * number as small as possible . we get 463 and 512 ( difference is 49 ) b

if n is a positive integer and n ^ 2 is divisible by 62 , then the largest positive integer that must divide n is
Answer: 12
Explanation: the question asks aboutthe largest positive integer that must divide n , not could divide n . since the least value of n for which n ^ 2 is a multiple of 72 is 12 then the largest positive integer that must divide n is 12 . complete solution of this question is given above . please ask if anything remains unclear . i spent a few hours on this one alone and i ' m still not clear . i chose 12 at first , but then changed to 48 . i ' m not a native speaker , so here is how i interpreted this question : the largest positive integer that must divide n = the largest positive factor of n . since n is a variable ( i . e . n is moving ) , so is its largest factor . please correct if i ' m wrong here . i know that if n = 12 , n ^ 2 = 144 = 2 * 72 ( satisfy the condition ) . when n = 12 , the largest factor of n is n itself , which is 12 . check : 12 is the largest positive number that must divide 12 - - > true however if n = 48 , n ^ 2 = 48 * 48 = 32 * 72 ( satisfy the condition too ) . when n = 48 , the largest factor of n is n itself , which is 48 . check : 48 is the largest positive number that must divide 48 - - > true so , i also notice that the keyword ismust , notcould . the question is , why is 48 notmust divide 48 , but instead onlycould divide 48 ? i ' m not clear right here . why is 12 must divide 12 ? what ' s the difference between them ? only restriction we have on positive integer n is that n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 . the least value of n for which n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 is 12 , thus nmustbe divisible by 12 ( n is in any case divisible by 12 ) . for all other values of n , for which n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 , n will still be divisible by 12 . this means that n is always divisible by 12 if n ^ 2 is divisible by 72 . now , ask yourself : if n = 12 , is n divisible by 48 ? no . so , n is not always divisible by 48 . b

a trainer is standing in one corner of a square ground of side 25 m . his voice can be heard upto 140 m . find the area of the ground in which his voice can be heard ?
Answer: C
Explanation: area covered by goat = pi * r ^ 2 / 4 ( here we divide by 4 because the trainer is standing in a corner of the ground and only in 1 / 4 part , the voice can be heard ) where r = 14 m = length reaching the voice so area = ( 22 / 7 ) * 140 * 140 / 4 = 15400 sq m

machine m , n , o working simultaneously machine m can produce x units in 3 / 4 of the time it takes machine n to produce the same amount of units . machine n can produce x units in 2 / 7 the time it takes machine o to produce that amount of units . if all 3 machines are working simultaneously , what fraction of the total output is produced by machine n ?
Answer: 7 / 13
Explanation: now ultimately the speed of every machine is given with respect to mach o . so lets assume the speed of o , say 12 hrs to make x units ( assuming 6 because we can see we will need to divide by 3 and 4 mach o makes x units in 12 hrs so , mach n = 2 / 7 of o = 2 / 7 * 12 = 24 / 7 hrs to make x units and mach m = 3 / 4 of n = 3 / 4 * 24 / 7 = 1 / 6 hrs to make x units no they are running simultaneously . lets see how much each mach makes in 1 hr mach o = x / 12 units mach n = 7 / 24 units mach m = x / 6 units in 1 hr , together they make - x / 12 + 7 / 24 + x / 6 = 13 / 24 so what ratio of this has mach n made ? ( 7 / 24 ) / ( 13 / 24 ) = 7 / 13 ans : b = 7 / 13

the figure above shows the dimensions of a semicircular cross section of a one - way tunnel . the single traffic lane is 12 feet wide and is equidistant from the sides of the tunnel . if vehicles must clear the top of the tunnel by at least ½ foot when they are inside the traffic lane , what should be the limit h on the height of vehicles that are allowed to use the tunnel ?
Answer: 7 ½ ft
Explanation: let ' s label the midpoint of the circle o . since the base of the semi - circle is 20 , we know that the diameter is 20 and , accordingly , the radius is 10 . we also know that the traffic lane is 12 feet long and there ' s an equal amount of space on either side , so the traffic lane extends 6 feet on either side of o . let ' s call the leftmost point on the base of the traffic lane a . so , the distance oa is 6 . now draw a line straight up from a to the top of the tunnel . let ' s label the point at which the line intersects the circle b . the answer to the question will , therefore , be the height ab - . 5 feet ( we need to leave . 5 feet of clearance ) . here ' s the key to solving the question : if we draw a line from o to b , that line is a radius of the circle and , therefore , has length 10 . we now have right triangle oab ( the right angle is at point a ) , with leg oa = 6 and hypotenuse ob = 10 . we can now solve for leg ab = 8 ( either by applying the pythagorean theorum or by applying the 3 / 4 / 5 special right triangle ratio ) . finally : ab = 8 , so the correct answer h is 8 - . 5 = 7.5 . . . choose ( b ) ! from a strategic guessing point of view , as soon as we realize that the height of the tunnel is 10 in the middle , we should quickly eliminate ( d ) and ( e ) as too big ; worse case you have a 1 / 3 shot at picking up the points . b

what is the units digit of 2222 ^ ( 333 ) * 3333 ^ ( 444 ) ?
Answer: 4
Explanation: each of the other explanations to this question has properly explained that you need to break down the calculation into pieces and figure out the repeatingpatternof the units digits . here ' s another way to organize the information . we ' re given [ ( 2222 ) ^ 333 ] [ ( 3333 ) ^ 222 ] we can ' combine ' some of the pieces and rewrite this product as . . . . ( [ ( 2222 ) ( 3333 ) ] ^ 222 ) [ ( 2222 ) ^ 111 ] ( 2222 ) ( 3333 ) = a big number that ends in a 6 taking a number that ends in a 6 and raising it to a power creates a nice pattern : 6 ^ 1 = 6 6 ^ 2 = 36 6 ^ 3 = 216 etc . thus , we know that ( [ ( 2222 ) ( 3333 ) ] ^ 222 ) will be a gigantic number that ends in a 6 . 2 ^ 111 requires us to figure out thecycleof the units digit . . . 2 ^ 1 = 2 2 ^ 2 = 4 2 ^ 3 = 8 2 ^ 4 = 16 2 ^ 5 = 32 2 ^ 6 = 64 2 ^ 7 = 128 2 ^ 8 = 256 so , every 4 powers , the pattern of the units digits repeats ( 2 , 4 , 8 , 6 . . . . . 2 , 4 , 8 , 6 . . . . ) . 111 = 27 sets of 4 with a remainder of 3 . . . . this means that 2 ^ 111 = a big number that ends in an 8 so we have to multiply a big number that ends in a 6 and a big number that ends in an 8 . ( 6 ) ( 8 ) = 48 , so the final product will be a gigantic number that ends in an 4 . final

what is the area inscribed by the lines y = 10 , x = 1 , y = 3 x + 1 on an xy - coordinate plane ?
Answer: d ) 6
Explanation: first , let ' s graph the lines y = 10 and x = 1 at this point , we need to find the points where the line y = 3 x + 1 intersects the other two lines . for the vertical line , we know that x = 1 , so we ' ll plug x = 1 into the equation y = 3 x + 1 to get y = 3 ( 1 ) + 1 = 4 perfect , when x = 1 , y = 5 , so one point of intersection is ( 1,4 ) for the horizontal line , we know that y = 10 , so we ' ll plug y = 10 into the equation y = 3 x + 1 to get 10 = 3 x + 1 . solve to get : x = 3 so , when y = 10 , x = 3 , so one point of intersection is ( 3,10 ) now add these points to our graph and sketch the line y = 3 x + 1 at this point , we can see that we have the following triangle . the base has length 2 and the height is 6 area = ( 1 / 2 ) ( base ) ( height ) = ( 1 / 2 ) ( 2 ) ( 6 ) = 6

a certain experimental mathematics program was tried out in 2 classes in each of 22 elementary schools and involved 31 teachers . each of the classes had 1 teacher and each of the teachers taught at least 1 , but not more than 3 , of the classes . if the number of teachers who taught 3 classes is n , then the least and greatest possible values of n , respectively , are
Answer: 1 and 6
Explanation: one may notice that greatest possible values differ in each answer choice in contrast to the least values , which repeat . to find out the greatest value you should count the total classes ( 22 * 2 = 44 ) , then subtract the total # of teachers since we know from the question that each teacher taught at least one class ( 44 - 31 = 13 ) . thus we get a number of the available extra - classes for teachers , and all that we need is just to count how many teachers could take 2 more classes , which is 13 / 2 = 6.5 . so the greatest possible value of the # of teachers who had 3 classes is 6 . only answer d has this option .

when positive integer k is divided by 5 , the remainder is 2 . when k is divided by 6 , the remainder is 5 . if k is less than 41 , what is the remainder when k is divided by 7 ?
Answer: 3
Explanation: cant think of a straight approach but here is how i solved it : k is divided by 5 and remainder is 2 . this means k = 5 n + 2 ( n is an integer ) so the possible values of k = { 2 , 7 , 12 , 17 , 22 , 27 , 32 , 37 } ( less than 41 ) secondly , if k is divided by 6 , the remainder is 5 = > k = 6 m + 5 so the possible value set for k = { 5 , 11 , 17 , 23 , 29,35 } ( less than 41 ) 17 is the only common number in both the sets . hence k = 17

Answer: B
Explanation: given quantities of b and c are equal . therefore instead of considering them as a different quantities take average of both and consider it as a single entity . so the cost of the mixture ` ` d ' ' ( equal quantities of ` ` b ' ' and ` ` c ' ' ) is 170 / 2 = 85 rs / kg now the tea contains only ` ` a ' ' of 95 rs / per and ` ` d ' ' of 85 rs / kg . it is clearly seen that ` ` a ' ' is 5 more and ` ` d ' ' is 5 less than the required cost per kg . therefore 50 / 50 will go well . a = 50 kg and d = 50 kg . ( d = b & c in equal ratio ) . therefore b & c = 25 kg each . ( a : b : c ) = ( 50 , 2525 )

a machine , working at a constant rate , manufactures 20 candles in 40 minutes . how many candles does it make in 1 hr 20 min ?
Answer: 40
Explanation: change 1 hr 20 min to 80 min . for this , we need to set up a simple proportion of staplers per time 20 / 40 = s / 80 the absolutely worst thing you could do at this point in the problem is to cross - multiply . that would be a supremely unstrategic move . instead , cancel before you multiply . for what we can and can ’ t cancel in a proportion , seethis post . we can cancel the factor of 10 in the 20 and 40 . 2 / 4 = s / 80 1 / 2 = s / 80 ; 1 / 2 * 2 = s / 80 * 2 1 / 1 = s / 40 now that the fraction is entirely simplified , we can cross - multiply . s = 1 * 40 = 40 the machine would be 40 candles in 1 hr 20 min . answer : c .

a not - so - good clockmaker has four clocks on display in the window . clock # 1 loses 45 minutes every hour . clock # 2 gains 15 minutes every hour relative to clock # 1 ( i . e . , as clock # 1 moves from 12 : 00 to 1 : 00 , clock # 2 moves from 12 : 00 to 1 : 15 ) . clock # 3 loses 20 minutes every hour relative to clock # 2 . finally , clock # 4 gains 20 minutes every hour relative to clock # 3 . if the clockmaker resets all four clocks to the correct time at 12 noon , what time will clock # 4 display after 6 actual hours ( when it is actually 6 : 00 pm that same day ) ?
Answer: 6 : 34
Explanation: c 1 loses 15 minutes every hour . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 1 displays that 60 - 15 = 45 minutes have passed . c 2 gains 15 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 1 . thus , the time displayed on c 2 is 75 / 60 = 5 / 4 the time displayed on c 1 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 2 displays the passing of ( 5 / 4 * 45 ) minutes . c 3 loses 20 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 2 . thus , the time displayed on c 3 is 40 / 60 = 2 / 3 the time displayed on c 2 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 3 displays the passing of ( 2 / 3 * 5 / 4 * 45 ) minutes . c 4 gains 20 minutes for every 60 minutes displayed on c 3 . thus , the time displayed on c 4 is 80 / 60 = 4 / 3 the time displayed on clock 3 . so after 60 minutes have passed , c 4 displays the passing of 4 / 3 * 2 / 3 * 5 / 4 * 45 = 50 minutes . c 4 loses 10 minutes every hour . in 6 hours , c 4 will lose 6 * 10 = 60 minutes = 1 hour . since the correct time after 6 hours will be 6 pm , c 4 will show a time of 6 - 1 = 6 : 34 pm . the correct answer is d .

a test has 120 questions . each question has 5 options , but only 1 option is correct . if test - takers mark the correct option , they are awarded 1 point . however , if an answer is incorrectly marked , the test - taker loses 0.25 points . no points are awarded or deducted if a question is not attempted . a certain group of test - takers attempted different numbers of questions , but each test - taker still received the same net score of 40 . what is the maximum possible number of such test - takers ?
Answer: 17
Explanation: a correct answers get you 1 point , an incorrect answer gets you minus 1 / 4 point and a skipped question gets you 0 points . since there are 200 total questions , there are a variety of ways to get a total of 40 points . let c be the number of correct answers and let i be the number of incorrect answers . to get 40 points , a test taker must have at least 40 correct answers . then c = > 40 . for every correct question above 40 , the test taker has 4 incorrect answers . then , the i = 4 * ( c - 40 ) . also , i + c < = 120 . thus 5 c < = 280 and so c < = 56 . then 40 < = c < = 56 and c can have 17 possible values . the answer is d .

a = 2 ^ 15 - 625 ^ 3 and a / x is an integer , where x is a positive integer greater than 1 , such that it does not have a factor p such that 1 < p < x , then how many different values for x are possible ?
Answer: one
Explanation: this is a tricky worded question and i think the answer is should be d not c . . . here is my reason : the stem says that x is a positive integer such that has no factor grater than 2 and less than x itself . the stem wants to say that x is a prime number . because any prime number has no factor grater than 1 and itself . on the other hand the stem says that x could get how many different number not must get different number ( this is very important issue ) as our friends say , if we simplify numerator more we can obtain : 5 ^ 12 ( 5 ^ 3 - 1 ) = 5 ^ 12 ( 124 ) = 5 ^ 12 ( 31 * 2 * 2 ) divided by x and we are told that this fraction is an integer . so , x could be ( not must be ) 5 , 31 , or 2 ! ! ! so , x could get 1 different values and answer is b . . . .

if 5 machines can produce 20 units in 10 hours , how long would it take 20 machines to produce 140 units ?
Answer: 17.5 hours
Explanation: here , we ' re told that 5 machines can produce 20 units in 10 hours . . . . that means that each machine works for 10 hours apiece . since there are 5 machines ( and we ' re meant to assume that each machine does the same amount of work ) , then the 5 machines equally created the 20 units . 20 units / 5 machines = 4 units are made by each machine every 10 hours now that we know how long it takes each machine to make 4 units , we can break this down further if we choose to . . . 10 hours / 4 units = 2.5 hours per unit when 1 machine is working . the prompt asks us how long would it take 20 machines to produce 140 units . if 20 machines each work for 2.5 hours , then we ' ll have 20 units . since 140 units is ' 7 times ' 20 , we need ' 7 times ' more time . ( 2.5 hours ) ( 7 times ) = 17.5 hours final answer : [ reveal ] spoiler : c

in a garden , there are yellow and green flowers which are straight and curved . if the probability of picking a green flower is 1 / 6 and picking a straight flower is 1 / 2 , then what is the probability of picking a flower which is yellow and straight
Answer: 3 / 7
Explanation: good question . so we have a garden where all the flowers have two properties : color ( green or yellow ) and shape ( straight or curved ) . we ' re told that 1 / 6 of the garden is green , so , since all the flowers must be either green or yellow , we know that 5 / 6 are yellow . we ' re also told there is an equal probability of straight or curved , 1 / 2 . we want to find out the probability of something being yellow and straight , pr ( yellow and straight ) . so if we recall , the probability of two unique events occurring simultaneously is the product of the two probabilities , pr ( a and b ) = p ( a ) * p ( b ) . so we multiply the two probabilities , pr ( yellow ) * pr ( straight ) = 5 / 6 * 1 / 2 = 3 / 7 , or d .

a 20 litre mixture of milk and water contains milk and water in the ratio 3 : 2 . 10 litres of the mixture is removed and replaced with pure milk and the operation is repeated once more . at the end of the two removal and replacement , what is the ratio w of milk and water in the resultant mixture ?
Answer: 9 : 1
Explanation: he 20 litre mixture contains milk and water in the ratio of 3 : 2 . therefore , there will be 12 litres of milk in the mixture and 8 litres of water in the mixture . step 1 . when 10 litres of the mixture is removed , 6 litres of milk is removed and 4 litres of water is removed . therefore , there will be 6 litres of milk and 4 litres of water left in the container . it is then replaced with pure milk of 10 litres . now the container will have 16 litres of milk and 4 litres of water . step 2 . when 10 litres of the new mixture is removed , 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water is removed . the container will have 8 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it . now 10 litres of pure milk is added . therefore , the container will have 18 litres of milk and 2 litres of water in it at the end of the second step . therefore , the ratio of milk and water is 18 : 2 or 9 : 1 . shortcut . we are essentially replacing water in the mixture with pure milk . let w _ o be the amount of water in the mixture originally = 8 litres . let w _ r be the amount of water in the mixture after the replacements have taken place . then , { w _ r } / { w _ o } = ( 1 - r / m ) ^ n where r is the amount of the mixture replaced by milk in each of the steps , m is the total volume of the mixture and n is the number of times the cycle is repeated . hence , { w _ r } / { w _ o } = ( 1 / 2 ) ^ 2 = 1 / 4 therefore w , w _ r = { w _ o } / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2 litres . b

a dessert recipe calls for 50 % melted chocolate and 50 % raspberry puree to make a particular sauce . a chef accidentally makes 15 cups of the sauce with 30 % melted chocolate and 70 % raspberry puree instead . how many cups of the sauce does he need to remove and replace with pure melted chocolate to make the sauce the proper 50 % of each ?
Answer: 2.14
Explanation: yes , we assume that the mix is homogeneous . otherwise , we will not be able to solve the question . you have 15 cups of sauce with 30 % chocolate . you also have unlimited amount of pure chocolate sauce . now you need to mix these two in such a way that you get total 15 cups of sauce with 50 % chocolate . using scale method : w 1 / w 2 = ( 100 - 50 ) / ( 50 - 30 ) = 5 / 2 w 1 - amount of 30 % chocolate sauce w 2 - amount of pure chocolate sauce so for every 5 / 2 cups of 30 % chocolate sauce , we need 2 cup of pure chocolate sauce . this will give us 7 cups of 50 % chocolate sauce . but we need 15 cups of 50 % chocolate sauce . so we need to mix 5 * 15 / 7 = 12.5 cups of 40 % chocolate sauce with 1 * 15 / 7 = 2.14 cups of pure chocolate sauce . answer ( b )

a pharmaceutical company received $ 6 million in royalties on the first $ 20 million in sales of the generic equivalent of one of its products and then $ 9 million in royalties on the next $ 108 million in sales . by approximately what percent did the ratio of royalties to sales decrease from the first $ 20 million in sales to the next $ 108 million in sales ?
Answer: 72 %
Explanation: solution : this is a percent decrease problem . we will use the formula : percent change = ( new – old ) / old x 100 to calculate the final answer . we first set up the ratios of royalties to sales . the first ratio will be for the first 20 million in sales , and the second ratio will be for the next 108 million in sales . because all of the sales are in millions , we do not have to express all the trailing zeros in our ratios . first 20 million royalties / sales = 6 / 20 = 3 / 10 next 108 million royalties / sales = 9 / 108 = 1 / 12 because each ratio is not an easy number to use , we can simplify each one by multiplying each by the lcm of the two denominators , which is 60 . keep in mind that we are able to do this only because our answer choices are expressed in percents . first 20 million royalties / sales = ( 6 / 20 ) x 60 = 18 next 108 million royalties / sales = 9 / 108 = ( 1 / 12 ) x 60 = 5 we can plug 18 and 5 into our percent change formula : ( new – old ) / old x 100 [ ( 5 – 18 ) / 18 ] x 100 - 650 / 9 x 100 at this point we can stop and consider the answer choices . since we know that 650 / 9 is just a bit less than ½ , we know that - 650 / 9 x 100 is about a 72 % decrease . answer e .

bill spends two days driving from point a to point b . on the first day , he drove 2 hours longer and at an average speed 5 miles per hour faster than he drove on the second day . if during the two days he drove a total of 680 miles over the course of 18 hours , what was his average speed on the second day , in miles per hour ?
Answer: 35
Explanation: first recognize that we have two pieces of information regarding the time bill spent driving each day . on day 1 , bill drove 2 hours longer than he drove on day 2 . so , let x = # of driving hours on day 2 then x + 2 = # of driving hours on day 1 bill drove a total of 18 hours so , x + ( x + 2 ) = 18 simplify : 2 x + 2 = 18 solve , x = 8 so , bill drove 10 hours on day 1 and he drove 8 hours on day 2 now let ' s solve the question by starting with a word equation . let x = speed driven on day 2 so , x + 5 = speed driven on day 1 ( distance traveled on day 1 ) + ( distance traveled on day 2 ) = 680 distance = ( rate ) ( time ) we get : ( x + 5 ) ( 10 ) + ( x ) ( 8 ) = 680 expand : 10 x + 50 + 8 x = 680 simplify : 18 x + 50 = 680 18 x = 630 x = 35 ( mph )

the speed of a railway engine is 63 km per hour when no compartment is attached , and the reduction in speed is directly proportional to the square root of the number of compartments attached . if the speed of the train carried by this engine is 24 km per hour when 9 compartments are attached , the maximum number of compartments that can be carried by the engine is :
Answer: 23
Explanation: the reduction in speed is directly proportional to the square root of the number of compartments attached does reduction mean amount subtracted ? or percentage decrease ? there are at least two interpretations , and the wording does not provide a clear interpretation between them . evidently what the question intends is the subtraction interpretation . what is subtracted from the speed is directly proportional to the square root of the number of compartments attached . in other words , if s = speed , and n = number of compartments , then s = 63 - k * sqrt ( n ) where k is a constant of the proportionality . in general , if a is directly proportional to b , we can write a = k * b and solve for k . if n = 9 , then s = 24 24 = 63 - k * sqrt ( 9 ) = 63 - 3 k k = 13 now , we need to know : what value of n makes s go to zero ? 0 = 63 - 13 * sqrt ( n ) 13 * sqrt ( n ) = 63 n = 23 with 24 compartments , the train does not budge . therefore , it would budge if there were one fewer cars . thus , 23 is the maximum number of cars the engine can pull and still move . e

the “ s - number ” of a number x is defined as the ones digit of 2 ^ x . antony rolls a die with 6 sides labeled with the integers from 1 to 6 , each of which has an equal probability of landing face - up . he then takes 3 ^ s , where s is the s - number of the result of his die roll , and plots 3 ^ s on a number line as the point a . finally , he repeats this entire process , this time plotting the result as the point b . what is the probability that the distance between a and b is greater than the value of b ?
Answer: 13 / 36
Explanation: if you calculate 3 ^ s for 1 st roll , all 6 results will be 9 , 81 , 6561 , 729 , 9 , 81 . this result is the same for 2 nd roll . 9 , 81 , 6561 , 729 , 9 , 81 . about distance : if the first result is 9 and the second is also 9 , the distance is 9 - 9 = 0 which is smaller than 9 . if the first result is 9 and the second is 81 , the distance is 81 - 9 = 72 which is also smaller than b which has the value of 81 . if the first result is 81 and the second is 9 , the distance will be greater than b . distance 81 - 9 = 72 > 9 . on the first roll , the probability of getting result 9 is 2 / 6 . in this case no other alternative values for second roll which would make the distance greater than b . so probability is 0 . so next estimations are : probability of getting 81 on the first roll ( 2 / 6 ) * probability of getting 9 on the second roll ( 2 / 6 ) = 1 / 9 probability of getting 729 on the first roll ( 1 / 6 ) * probability of getting 9 , 81 on the second roll ( 4 / 6 ) = 1 / 9 probability of getting 6561 on the first roll ( 1 / 6 ) * probability of getting 9 , 81 , 729 on the first roll ( 5 / 6 ) = 5 / 36 all together : 1 / 9 + 1 / 9 + 5 / 36 = 13 / 36 = b

of the 3 - digit integers greater than 200 , how many have two digits that are equal to each other and the remaining digit different from the other two ?
Answer: 36
Explanation: let the three digit number be represented as x y z . there are 3 cases : case i . [ x = y ] z is not equal to xy : xxzoryyz x can be either 7 , 8 or 9 , so digit at x can be chosen in 3 ways after x is chosen , y can be chosen in 1 way after xy are chosen , z can be chosen in 9 ways thus , possible no of digits = ( 3 ways ) * ( 1 way ) * ( 9 ways ) = 27 . . . . ( 1 ) [ example numbers : 774,779 , 882,993 etc ] case ii . [ x = z ] y is not equal to xz : xyxorzyz x can be either 7 , 8 or 9 , so digit at x can be chosen in 3 ways after x is chosen , z can be chosen in 1 way after xz are chosen , z can be chosen in 9 ways thus , possible no of digits = ( 3 ways ) * ( 9 ways ) * ( 1 way ) = 27 . . . . ( 2 ) [ example numbers : 747,797 , 828,939 etc ] case iii . [ y = z ] x is not equal to yz : xyyorxzz x can be either 7 , 8 or 9 , so digit at x can be chosen in 3 ways after x is chosen , y can be chosen in 9 ways after y is chosen , z can have 1 way thus , possible no of digits = ( 3 ways ) * ( 1 way ) * ( 9 ways ) = 27 . . . . ( 3 ) [ example numbers : 744,799 , 822,933 etc ] therefore , total numbers of possible digits [ sum of case ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) ( 3 ) above ] = 27 + 27 + 27 - 1 = 80 one digit is subtracted from total number of possible digits to eliminate one possibility of xyz = 700 to satisfy the condition that digit > 200 . answer : ( e )

a lady grows cabbage in her garden that is in the shape of a square . each cabbage takes 1 square foot of area in her garden . this year , she has increased her output by 127 cabbages when compared to last year . the shape of the area used for growing the cabbage has remained a square in both these years . how many cabbages did she produce this year ?
Answer: 4096
Explanation: explanatory answer the shape of the area used for growing cabbage has remained a square in both the years . let the side of the square area used for growing cabbage this year be x ft . therefore , the area of the ground used for cultivation this year = x 2 sq . ft . let the side of the square area used for growing cabbage last year be y ft . therefore , the area of the ground used for cultivation last year = y 2 sq . ft . as the number of cabbage grown has increased by 127 , the area would have increased by 127 sq ft because each cabbage takes 1 sq ft space . hence , x 2 - y 2 = 127 ( x + y ) ( x - y ) = 127 . 127 is a prime number and hence it will have only two factors . i . e . , 127 and 1 . therefore , 127 can be expressed as product of 2 numbers in only way = 127 * 1 i . e . , ( x + y ) ( x - y ) = 127 * 1 so , ( x + y ) should be 127 and ( x - y ) should be 1 . solving the two equations we get x = 64 and y = 63 . therefore , number of cabbage produced this year = x 2 = 642 = 4096 . alternative approach : use answer choices the area in both the years are squares of two numbers . that rules out choice b , c and d . as 4098,5000 and 5096 are not the square of any number . check choice a : if this year ' s produce is 4096 , last year ' s produce would have been 4096 - 127 = 3969 3969 is the square of 63 . so , 4096 is the answer . choice a

Explanation: total applicants = 40 political science = 15 and non political science = 40 - 15 = 25 gpa > 3.0 = 20 and gpa < = 3.0 = 20 10 non political science students had gpa < = 3.0 - - > 15 non political science students had gpa > 3.0 gpa > 3.0 in political science = total - ( gpa > 3.0 in non political science ) q = 20 - 15 = 5

the sum of the squares of the first 15 positive integers ( 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + 3 ^ 2 + . . . + 15 ^ 2 ) is equal to 1270 . what is the sum of the squares of the second 15 positive integers ( 16 ^ 2 + 17 ^ 2 + 18 ^ 2 + . . . + 30 ^ 2 ) ?
Answer: 8245
Explanation: you ' ll never need a formula for the sums of squares on the actual gmat . you do n ' t need to use that formula here , though it ' s not all that straightforward to solve without one . two different approaches : 16 ^ 2 + 17 ^ 2 + 18 ^ 2 + . . . + 30 ^ 2 = ( 15 + 1 ) ^ 2 + ( 15 + 2 ) ^ 2 + ( 15 + 3 ) ^ 2 + . . . + ( 15 + 15 ) ^ 2 now we can expand each square ; they are all in the ( x + y ) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 2 xy + y ^ 2 pattern . = ( 15 ^ 2 + 2 * 15 + 1 ^ 2 ) + ( 15 ^ 2 + 4 * 15 + 2 ^ 2 ) + ( 15 ^ 2 + 6 * 15 + 3 ^ 2 ) + . . . + ( 15 ^ 2 + 30 * 15 + 15 ^ 2 ) now we have fifteen 15 ^ 2 terms , so adding these gives 15 * 15 ^ 2 = 15 ^ 3 = 3375 . we also have the entire sum 1 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 + . . . + 15 ^ 2 , which we know is equal to 1240 . finally adding the middle terms , we have : 2 * 15 + 4 * 15 + 6 * 15 + . . . + 30 * 15 = 15 ( 2 + 4 + 6 + . . . . + 30 ) = 15 * 2 * ( 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 15 ) = 15 * 2 * 8 * 15 = 3600 so the sum must be 3375 + 1240 + 3600 = 8215 alternatively , we can use a different factoring pattern . we want to find the value of 30 ^ 2 + 29 ^ 2 + . . . + 17 ^ 2 + 16 ^ 2 . well if we subtract 15 ^ 2 + 14 ^ 2 + . . . . + 2 ^ 2 + 1 ^ 2 from this , the answer will be 1240 less than what we want to find . so if we can find the value of 30 ^ 2 + 29 ^ 2 + . . . + 17 ^ 2 + 16 ^ 2 - ( 15 ^ 2 + 14 ^ 2 + . . . . + 2 ^ 2 + 1 ^ 2 ) then we can add 1240 to get the answer . now grouping the terms above to get differences of squares , we have = ( 30 ^ 2 - 15 ^ 2 ) + ( 29 ^ 2 - 14 ^ 2 ) + . . . + ( 16 ^ 2 - 1 ^ 2 ) and factoring each of these using x ^ 2 - y ^ 2 = ( x + y ) ( x - y ) , we have = 45 * 15 + 43 * 15 + 41 * 15 + . . . + 17 * 15 = 15 ( 45 + 43 + 41 + . . . + 17 ) in brackets we have an equally spaced sum with fifteen terms , which we can evaluate using the familiar formula . so the above equals 15 * 15 * 62 / 2 = 6975 and adding back the 1270 , we get the answer of 8245 . ( ans d )

last week vartan spent 15 percent of his wages on recreation . this week , his wages are 10 percent less than last week ʼ s wages and he spent 30 percent of his wages on recreation . the amount he spends on recreation this week is what percent of the amount he spent on recreation last week ?

if a randomly selected non - negative single digit integer is added to { 2 , 3 , 4 , 9 } . what is the probability that the median of the set will increase but the range still remains the same ?
Answer: 0.6
Explanation: we are selecting from non - negative single digit integers , so from { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 } . these 10 digits represent the total number of outcomes . hence , the total number of outcomes is 10 . we need to find the probability that the median of the set will increase but the range still remains the same . the median of the set is ( 3 + 4 ) / 2 = 3.5 , thus the number selected must be 4 or greater . for the range to remain the same , the number must be between 2 and 9 inclusive . to satisfy both conditions , the number selected must be 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , or 9 . the probability is 6 / 10 = 0.6 the answer is e .

if the average ( arithmetic mean ) of 10 consecutive odd integers is 154 , then the least of these integers is
Answer: c ) 145
Explanation: a very helpful rule to know in arithmetic is the rule that in evenly spaced sets , average = median . because the average will equal the median in these sets , then we quickly know that the median of this set of consecutive odd integer numbers is 154 . there are 10 numbers in the set , and in a set with an even number of terms the median is just the average of the two most median terms ( here the 5 th and 6 th numbers in the set ) . this means that numbers 5 and 6 in this set are 153 and 155 . because we know that number 5 is 153 , we know that the smallest number is 4 odd numbers below this , which means that it is 4 * 2 = 8 below this ( every odd number is every other number ) . therefore 153 - 8 = 145 , answer choice c

the average weight of a class is x pounds . when a new student weighing 100 pounds joins the class , the average decreases by 1 pound . in a few months the student ’ s weight increases to 110 pounds and the average weight of the class becomes x + 4 pounds . none of the other students ’ weights changed . what is the value of x ?
Answer: 92
Explanation: when the student weighs 80 pounds the average weight is x - 1 pounds ; when the student weighs 110 pounds the average weight is x + 4 pounds . so , the increase in total weight of 110 - 80 = 30 pounds corresponds to the increase in average weight of ( x + 4 ) - ( x - 1 ) = 5 pounds , which means that there are 30 / 5 = 6 students ( including the new one ) . so , initially there were 5 student . total weight = 5 x + 80 = 6 ( x - 1 ) - - > x = 92 pounds . answer : e .

each of 3 investments has a 20 % of becoming worthless within a year of purchase , independently of what happens to the other two investments . if simone invests an equal sum v in each of these 3 investments on january 1 , the approximate chance that by the end of the year , she loses no more than 1 / 3 of her original investment is
Answer: 90 %
Explanation: the problem asks for the approximate chance that no more than 1 / 3 of the original investment is lost . we can apply the “ 1 – x ” technique : what ’ s the chance that more than 1 / 3 of the original investment is lost ? there are two outcomes we have to separately measure : ( a ) all 3 investments become worthless . ( b ) 2 of the 3 investments become worthless , while 1 doesn ’ t . outcome ( a ) : the probability is ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) = 0.008 , or a little less than 1 % . outcome ( b ) : call the investments x , y , and z . the probability that x retains value , while y and z become worthless , is ( 0.8 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) = 0.032 . now , we have to do the same thing for the specific scenarios in which y retains value ( while x and z don ’ t ) and in which z retains value ( while x and y don ’ t ) . each of those scenarios results in the same math : 0.032 . thus , we can simply multiply 0.032 by 3 to get 0.096 , or a little less than 10 % . the sum of these two probabilities is 0.008 + 0.096 = 0.104 , or a little more than 10 % . finally , subtracting from 100 % and rounding , we find that the probability we were looking for is approximately 90 % . the correct answer is a . this problem illustrates the power of diversification in financial investments . all else being equal , it ’ s less risky to hold a third of your money in three uncorrelated ( independent ) but otherwise equivalent investments than to put all your eggs in one of the baskets . that said , be wary of historical correlations ! housing price changes in different us cities were not so correlated — and then they became highly correlated during the recent housing crisis ( they all fell together ) , fatally undermining spreadsheet models that assumed that these price changes were independent .
